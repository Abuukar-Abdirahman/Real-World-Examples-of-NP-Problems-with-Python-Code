# Real-World Examples of NP Problems

This repository contains real-world examples of classic NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) problems, with explanations, pseudocode, and Python implementations. These problems are widely studied in computer science due to their importance in optimization, scheduling, and resource allocation.
